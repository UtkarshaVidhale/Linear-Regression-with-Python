# Linear-Regression-with-Python
A linear regression model is built and fitted to a dataset using gradient descent 
# Introduction
Introduction to the problem
Introduction to the Rhyme interface

# Dataset
Refresher on linear regression
Create a function to synthesize data

# Initialize Parameters
Continue the refresher on linear regression
Start writing the linear model class

# Forward Pass
Refresher on gradient descent
Implement the forward pass

# Compute Loss
Extend the linear model and add a function to compute loss

# Backward Pass
Implement a backward pass function
Calculate gradients dW and db

# Update Parameters
Update the parameter values with gradients obtained with backward pass

# Training Loop
Implement the final training loop
Train the model

# Predictions
Get predictions from the trained model
Get predictions from an untrained model for comparison
